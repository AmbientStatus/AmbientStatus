Seamlesssly update your app based on the ambiance of your users.  Inspired by "Path Talk - The New Messenger," AmbientStatus offers all of the same "Ambient Status" features, with more to come.

> *From Path's "Path Talk - The New Messenger" Description*:
>
> Ambient Status:  Path talk can automatically tell your friends when you're in transit, in the neighborhood, or even low on battery so your availability is always understood &mdash; removing the headache of misunderstandings in conversation.

AmbientStatus provides delegates and properties for all of the features in the description above:
- **[Transit Monitor](https://github.com/AmbientStatus/ASTransitMonitor) `ASTransitMonitor`**
  - Whether the user is in transit, and the type of transit (Stationary, Walking, Running or Driving), and notifications of any change.
- **[Battery Monitor](https://github.com/AmbientStatus/ASBatteryMonitor) `ASBatteryMonitor`**
  - Provides battery percentage and state (Unknown, Unplugged, Charging or Full) for up to date battery level, and notifications of any change.
- **[Location Monitor](https://github.com/AmbientStatus/ASLocationMonitor) `ASLocationMonitor`** (Untested)
  - Detects if the user has entered within a `kMaximumRadius` of a location (`CLLocation`), and provides feedback upon leaving the area.

**AmbientStatus was planned to have a single header file - AmbientStatus.h - that was going to [conditionally include headers](Pod/Classes/AmbientStatus.h) based on [subspecs installed](AmbientStatus.podspec#L33).  This is not working.  See [issue #1](https://github.com/AmbientStatus/AmbientStatus) if you have any thoughts, please!**
